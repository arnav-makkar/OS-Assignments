The bonus section as well as all others have been completed.


Some commands which will not be supported are mentioned as follows with reasoning:

(a) Change of Directory:
Commands like cd and exit do not function since execvp() runs external programs, which cannot change the state of the shell itself.

(b) Foreground/Background Management:
Background commands (denoted with &) cannot be brought back to the foreground since there is no tracking of background processes.

(c) Signal Handling:
Signals like CTRL+C (interrupt) and CTRL+Z (suspend) are not handled properly, making the shell less interactive and responsive.

(d) Shell Substitution and Expansion:
Features like variable substitution and command expansion are not implemented, limiting flexibility in command execution.

(e) Background Processes with Pipes:
Background processes do not work correctly for piped commands, as the shell only manages simple background command execution.
